## 🦊 About Vulfram

**Vulfram** is a **rendering and systems core** written in Rust and exposed as a dynamic library. The name combines "Vulppi" (derived from _Vulpes_, the scientific name for fox) and "Frame", representing our mission to create perfect frames for incredible interactive experiences.

Vulfram is designed to be **host-agnostic** and driven by external runtimes via FFI or WASM:

- 🟢 **Node.js** (N-API)
- 🌙 **Lua** (via `mlua`)
- 🐍 **Python** (via `PyO3`)
- 🔧 Any environment capable of calling C-ABI functions
- 🌐 Browser runtimes via WASM (WebGPU + DOM canvas)

### Core Features

- 🚀 **High Performance**: GPU-accelerated rendering with WGPU (WebGPU)
- 🔄 **Cross-Platform**: Native support for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- 🎮 **Complete Input System**: Keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepads (via Gilrs)
- 🪟 **Advanced Window Management**: Full control over multiple windows (via Winit) or a DOM canvas (WASM)
- 💡 **Lighting & Shadows**: Support for various light types and shadow mapping
- 🎨 **Materials & Textures**: Flexible resource management for rendering
- 🔌 **Language Bindings**: N-API (Node.js), Lua, Python, and more. With C-ABI, `bun:ffi` is also possible.
- ⚡ **MessagePack Communication**: Fast binary serialization for commands and events
- 🎯 **Host-Agnostic Design**: No assumptions about ECS, OOP, or game framework

---

## 💡 Design Philosophy

Vulfram follows a **black box** approach where:

> The host controls the engine **only** through:
>
> - A small set of C functions (`vulfram_*`)
> - Binary buffers serialized with **MessagePack**

**Design Goals:**

- **Host-agnostic**: Works with any game framework or architecture
- **Minimal public surface**: Only essential C-ABI functions exposed
- **Binary and fast**: MessagePack for structured data, raw bytes for heavy assets
- **Clear separation**: Host manages logic and IDs, Core manages GPU and rendering
- **Async linking**: Components/resources can be created in any order, using fallbacks until data is available

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

Vulfram uses a queue-based architecture that enables efficient communication between the host and the Rust core:

```

### Responsibilities

**Host (Your Game/App):**

- Manage game logic and world state
- Generate logical IDs (entities, resources, buffers)
- Build MessagePack command batches
- Drive the main loop with `vulfram_tick()`
- Process events and responses

**Vulfram Core:**

- Abstract window, input, and rendering systems via platform proxies
- Manage GPU resources and pipelines using WGPU
- Track component instances (cameras, models, etc.)
- Translate commands into internal state changes
- Render frames efficiently

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Components vs Resources

Vulfram distinguishes between two fundamental types:

**Components** - High-level structures describing scene participation:

- Always attached to a host-chosen ID (e.g. `camera_id`, `model_id`, `light_id`)
- Examples: `Camera`, `Model`, `Light`
- Can contain static data (local colors, matrices)
- Reference sharable resources by logical ID
- Created/updated via MessagePack commands

**Resources** - Reusable assets used by components:

- Identified by logical IDs: `GeometryId`, `MaterialId`, `TextureId`
- Sharable across multiple components/entities
- Have internal GPU handles (buffers, textures, pipelines)
- Examples: geometries, textures, materials

### Logical IDs

The host manages all logical identifiers:

- `WindowId` - Window instances
- `CameraId` - Camera instances
- `ModelId` - Model instances
- `LightId` - Light instances
- `GeometryId` - Mesh/geometry assets
- `MaterialId` - Material configurations
- `TextureId` - Texture assets
- `BufferId` - Upload blob identifiers

These are opaque integers to the core. The host ensures uniqueness and consistency.

### Asynchronous Resource Linking (Fallback-Driven)

Vulfram allows resources to be created out of order:

- Models can reference geometry or material IDs that do not exist yet.
- Materials can reference texture IDs that do not exist yet.

In these cases, Vulfram renders using fallback resources until the real
resources are created later with the same IDs. When a referenced resource
appears, it is picked up automatically on the next frame without recreating
the model or material.

This enables async streaming and decouples creation order.

### Layer Masking

Vulfram uses `u32` bitmasks for visibility control:

- `layerMaskCamera` - Specifies which layers a camera can see
- `layerMaskComponent` - Specifies which layers a model belongs to
- `layerMaskLight` - (Future) Which layers a light affects

**Visibility Rule:**

```text
Visible if: (layerMaskCamera & layerMaskComponent) > 0
```

This enables:

- World-only or UI-only cameras
- Team-based rendering
- Debug geometry filtering
- Multi-pass rendering strategies

### Reuse Semantics

- A single geometry can be referenced by many models.
- A single material can be referenced by many models.
- A single texture can be referenced by many materials.

There is no ownership tracking. If a resource is disposed while still referenced,
rendering falls back gracefully.

### Render Ordering & Batching

Per camera:

- Opaque/masked objects are sorted by `material_id` then `geometry_id` to reduce
  state changes and batch draw calls.
- Transparent objects are sorted by depth for correct blending.

Draw calls are batched by runs of `(material_id, geometry_id)` after sorting.

### Upload System

Heavy data uses one-shot uploads:

1. Host calls `vulframUploadBuffer(bufferId, type, data)`
2. Core stores blob in internal upload table
3. `Create*` commands reference `bufferId` to consume data
4. Entry is marked as used and can be removed
5. `CmdUploadBufferDiscardAll` command clears all pending uploads

Uploads are independent of model/material creation, so you can create
components first and upload data later.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.70+ ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Vulkan**, **Metal**, or **DirectX 12** updated drivers

### Quick Start (Core Test Harness)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vulppi-dev/vulfram.git
cd vulfram

# Build and run the test harness
cargo run
```

The test harness lives in `src/main.rs` and exercises:

- window creation
- primitive geometry creation
- camera + model setup
- basic rendering loop

---

## 📚 Main Features

### Window Management

- Multiple window creation and management
- Window state control (normal, minimized, maximized, fullscreen)
- Position and size configuration
- Borderless and resizable options
- Custom window icons and cursors
- Drag-and-drop file support
- Window events (resize, move, focus, close)

### Input System

- **Keyboard**: Physical key events with modifiers and IME support
- **Mouse**: Movement, buttons, scroll wheel
- **Touch**: Multi-touch support with gestures (pinch, pan, rotate) on native
- **Pointer**: Unified API for mouse/touch/pen via `PointerEvent`
- **Gamepad**: Automatic detection, buttons, analog sticks, triggers (Gilrs on native, Gamepad API on web)
  - Standard mapping with dead zones
  - Change threshold filtering for efficient event generation

### Rendering (WGPU)

- GPU-accelerated rendering via WebGPU
- Cross-platform support (Vulkan, Metal, DirectX 12)
- Buffer upload for textures and meshes
- Efficient CPU-GPU synchronization
- Component-based rendering system
- Layer-based visibility control

### Communication

- **MessagePack** serialization for fast binary communication
- Separate queues for:
  - Commands (host → core)
  - Responses (core → host)
  - Events (core → host)
- Profiling data export for performance analysis

### Performance Optimizations

- **Event caching**: Filters duplicate events to reduce overhead
- **Redraw optimization**: Dirty flag system for selective rendering
- **Dead zone filtering**: Reduces gamepad noise
- **Batch processing**: Commands processed in bulk for efficiency

## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Build Rust core
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check code with Clippy
cargo clippy

# Format code
cargo fmt
```

### Recommended Development Loop

```text
1. Update host-side logic (game state, entities)
2. Upload heavy data (optional) via `vulfram_upload_buffer()`
3. Send command batch via `vulfram_send_queue()`
4. Advance the core via `vulfram_tick(time, delta_time)`
5. Receive responses via `vulfram_receive_queue()`
6. Receive events via `vulfram_receive_events()`
7. Read profiling data (optional) via `vulfram_get_profiling()`
```

`vulfram_receive_queue()` consumes and clears the internal response queue.
