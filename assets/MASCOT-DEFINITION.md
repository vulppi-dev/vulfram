Create a 2D stylized mascot character for a game engine called Vulfram.

The character is a digital fox named "Vulfi" (The Frame Fox).
He is a futuristic, neon-tech fox with a calm, confident expression.

Scene and composition:

- Medium shot, focusing on the head and upper body.
- Dark background, almost black with a subtle purple gradient.
- The fox slightly turned to the side, looking at the viewer, friendly but powerful.

Design:

- Clean geometric shapes mixed with soft curves.
- Big ears forming a subtle "V" shape.
- Tail partially visible with a blocky, pixel-like shape.

Colors:

- Main fur colors: deep purple and magenta tones.
- Use a warm analogous palette of purple → magenta → pink.
- Neon accents and highlights in bright magenta and soft pink.
- Eyes glowing with a soft pink/magenta light.

Effects:

- Light glitch effect: thin horizontal displacement lines across parts of the head or tail.
- Subtle scanline or pixel-drift effect to suggest frames and rendering.
- Soft neon glow around the fox, very controlled, not aggressive.

Style:

- Modern flat/illustrative style with light shading.
- No background clutter, focus on the character.
- Must be readable and iconic even at small sizes (like an app icon or Discord avatar).
